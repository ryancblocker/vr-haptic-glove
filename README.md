# vr-haptic-glove

This repository will hold all of the code, resources, and notes relating to my vr-haptic glove project. The glove will enbale the user to grab objects in virtual reality and the glove will restrict the users hand based upon the object they are grabbing. Currently developing for Meta Quest 2
