### 1/31/24 - Finished Rigid Mount and Threading Glove to Haptic Modules
This invloved me printed and reprinting the rigid mount for the glove over and over again until I found the desired bend to the mount that could alighn with my hand. Finnaly I had to install the haptic modules ot the ridig mount and install the foam and elstic strap to the mount as well. Finnally after securing the mout on top of the glove I had to carefully thread each of the strings from each modeul through the finger nodes tightly so that when I open and close my hand the reels open and close.
